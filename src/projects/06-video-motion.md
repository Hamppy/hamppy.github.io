        A number of animated references within the context of Hotelzon App were produced to support the demonstrational sessions booked through hotelzon.com as well as for promoting the concept and benefits of travel policy on social media. Both HTML5 canvas and conventional .mp4 were utilized according to the requirements of each applicable platform. Also html-shells for Google Display Network were active on selective affiliates within UK region.<br>
