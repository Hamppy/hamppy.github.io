  - header: "Reima Member-Get-Member Campaign"
    description: |
        Digital campaign for garment and kid’s wear manufacturer/reseller Reima to increase the amount of Club memberships. Reima started to supply the army with garments during World War II and soon grew to be a scandinavian exporter of kid’s clothes by the end of the 1950’s. Campaing was initiated by delivering a printed self-mailer with subscription codes to existing pre-selected customers who were then enabled to invite potential new customers to join. Today Reima is top-of-the-class provider and innovator of kid's weatherproof clothing products.<br>
