    description: |
        Veng is a M.Eng.-degree affiliated study project aimed at designing a user-friendly smartphone application that would both simplify and streamline flight booking during the challenging times of COVID-19 restrictions. The goal was to address the unique challenges faced by travelers, including navigating rapidly changing travel guidelines, ensuring safety compliance, and accessing real-time region-specific Covid updates. The COVID-19 pandemic stated significant challenges for air travel, with frequent policy changes, mandatory testing, and restricted destinations so travelers needed a comprehensive tool for assisting the planning process as well as for minimizing stress, and to stay informed about safety protocols. Frequent travelers such as business professionals and individuals looking to travel safely and efficiently during the pandemic were considered as the primary target group.<br>
        <br>
        The following objectives for the app were determined:
          <ul>
            <li>Ease of Use: Develop a straightforward and intuitive interface for booking flights.</li>
            <li>Real-Time Updates: Integrate dynamic updates on travel restrictions and COVID-19 policies.</li>
            <li>Transparency: Highlight health safety measures implemented by regions, airports, and nations.</li>
            <li>Flexibility: Facilitate options for flight cancellations and rescheduling.</li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Once after the goals were set the process initiated with a research under the context of which a number of random picked travelers were interviewed over the subject. Next steps was to sketch the most common user sceanarios as stroyboard sequencies. Based on the key insights, realizations, and ideation a visual prototype with a prefatory brand identity was created as an outcome by using Figma.</p>

        Established in 1984, Huoneistomyynti LKV is a reputable, privately-owned real estate brokerage company based in Helsinki. Specializing in the Helsinki metropolitan area and its surroundings, the company also handles holiday homes and plots nationwide. Original static and non-responsive web facade of Huoneistomyynti became modernized with WordPress CMS as well as by enhanced capabilities to enlist vacant, rentable, and zoned estates on website. Mobile optimization alone improved significantly the online appearance of the company and sales-wise elevated the possibilities to interact with clients.<br>

    description: |
        The initial WordPress CMS development version of Integral home page was for some reason pretty poorly mobile optimised and the overall appearance had no stimulants in order to get the users engaged. Also the possibilities of content updating for non technical operators were practically negligible. We made a fundamental deep dive in to the existing site structure in order to solve if we could somehow maintain the most of it while implementing a page building tool – that turned out to be a success and pretty soon we were ready to start developing content based on Growth Driven Design methodology.<br>

        Original Typo3 CMS of hotelzon.com site needed to be replaced with more flexible equivalent and during this procedure the layout as well as the content itself were refreshed in order to achieve more compelling user journey and optimal mobile performance. WordPress CMS was an obvious choice out of the different alternatives available and the experts from Roger Customer Experience Studio brought along their extensive experience over WordPress development and implementation. The outcome had wider possibilities from the content production / publication point of view and it also improved tracking features for system integration. Simultaneously marketing automation platform was integrated which created a timely opportunity for learning both landing page and email template development practices.<br>
