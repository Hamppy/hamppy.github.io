  - header: "Monthly Beverage - Floating cross-category trojan"
    description: |
        The monthly brewery product in HOK-Elanto's restaurant division served a dual purpose: as an affordable starter option and, depending on the item, as a somewhat more exotic cultural phenomenon in the world of beverages. Generally, the selection favored specialty products from well-known brands due to their steady and reliable availability in larger volumes. Additionally, the concept provided breweries with an opportunity to experiment with advertising targeted specifically at restaurant clientele, alongside their broader brand strategy initiatives.<br>
