  - header: "Virgin Oil Co menù da tavolo"
    description: |
        Virgin Oil Co. was a vibrant American-Italian restaurant and bar situated in the heart of Helsinki, Finland, at Mannerheimintie 5. Established back in 2006, it quickly became a popular destination for both locals and visitors, renowned for its wood-fired pizzas, diverse menu, and lively atmosphere. Virgin oil Co. featured a multi-level layout, with the ground floor housing the main dining area and bar, and an upper floor that hosted a club known for live music and performances. This combination made the establishment a versatile venue, catering to those seeking a dining experience, a casual drink, or evening entertainment. In addition to its culinary offerings, Virgin Oil Co. also operated the SpåraKoff, a unique pub tram that still provides circular tours of downtown Helsinki. After 13 years of operation, Virgin Oil Co. closed its doors in 2019, however it remains a fond memory for many, remembered for its contribution to Helsinki's dining and nightlife scene.<br>
        <br>
        Table menu of Virgin Oil Co. had to establish itself equally ambitious as the passion necessitated for sustaining such extensive variety of cuisine so expenses were not priority when the design, touch and feel, and eventually the packaging of 'Menù da tavolo' were conceived.<br>

  - header: "Gastropub Stone's"
    description: |
        Gastropub Stone's, located at Keskuskatu 4 in the heart of Helsinki, is renowned for its handcrafted burgers made from premium local ingredients and an extensive selection of specialty beers catering to discerning enthusiasts. The establishment's relaxed ambiance and rock-inspired decor make it a popular spot for both locals and visitors seeking a casual dining experience. Stone’s underwent quite extensive facelift during the summer 2012 and have kept it's appearance ever since. Along with the outfit came new cuisine and distinctive selection of beverages. I was inspired to deliver typography, textures, layout and visual aesthetics for graphics, photos plus campaign visuals in general.<br>

  - header: "Post Control Helsinki"
    description: |
        I designed the basics of visual identity for Helsinki based high-end post production company in Suvilahti Power Plant. The appearance was meant to evoke impressions about analogue precision and organicity as counterforces to the monoconformity of digital era. Among tv & cinema professionals the key colour red needs no further argumentations.<br>
